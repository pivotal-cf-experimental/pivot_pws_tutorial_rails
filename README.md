# Getting started with [Pivotal Web Services][pws] (PWS) on Rails

PWS is an installation of [Cloud Foundry][cf] that we host, similar to [Heroku][heroku]. Follow this tutorial if you know your project wants to host on PWS but you're not sure where to start.

## This is internal

There is another, public-facing *Getting Started with Rails on PWS* guide (not available at time of writing) that details much of the process required to get started with PWS, including command line usage and project setup.

This tutorial, on the other hand, is streamlined for Pivots who are familiar with Rails but who are unfamiliar with [PWS][pws]. It includes extra information such as [how to request sponsorship for your organization][sponsorship].

There are a few assumptions in this tutorial. It's up to the reader to work around them to suit the project:

- You're starting a new Rails project
- You want to use a postgres database
- You want to use a database at all

## Prerequisites

You should have:

- The Cloud Foundry client CLI `cf` available in your PATH and up-to-date.
- A PWS account
- Postgresql installed locally: `brew install postgresql`

If you installed `cf` with rubygems or Homebrew, uninstall it again and [download it through the Developer Console][tools].

For a guide to setting these things up, see [Getting Started with Pivotal Web Services][pws-getting-started].

## Setting up locally

Clone this repo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/pivot_pws_tutorial_rails
```

It's really just the result of:

```sh
rails new app_name --database=postgresql --skip-javascript --skip-test-unit
```

You could do that instead if you prefer.

Start the app locally.

```sh
cd pivot_pws_tutorial_rails
bin/rails server
```

<http://localhost:3000/> will let you know that you need a database. Do as Rails says to get a local one. Refresh the page. You should now see the vanilla Rails "Welcome aboard" message.

### If the app doesn't tell you about a missing database locally

You need to have postgresql running. Follow the instructions in `brew info postgresql`.

## Pushing the app

First, let's log in to PWS from the CLI.

```sh
cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io
```

Fill in your credentials and choose the org through which you wish to deploy your app. Unless you have more than one space, you'll probably be placed into the 'development' space. This is fine for the tutorial.

Let's see what apps are in the space.

```sh
cf apps
```

You may well get 'No apps found'. Let's change that by trying to push our app.

```sh
cf push
```

Oh no! It looks like 'App name is a required field'. You could stick the app name in a manifest.yml, but let's just provide it on the command line for now.

```sh
cf push $YOUR_UNIQUE_APP_NAME
```

If all went well, you should see lots of output and then a summary of the pushed app's status.

```
requested state: started
instances: 1/1
usage: 1G x 1 instances
urls: your-unique-app-name.cfapps.io

     state     since                    cpu    memory        disk
#0   running   2014-09-03 12:06:33 PM   0.0%   93.3M of 1G   89.2M of 1G
```

The app is running on PWS. Congrats!

### If the push failed

If you get a message like this:

`
Server error, status code: 400, error code: 100005, message: You have exceeded your organization's memory limit.
`

â€¦then you probably ran out of trial and need your org to be [sponsored][sponsorship].

## Visiting the site after the first push

Visiting your shiny new site at http://your-unique-app-name.cfapps.io/ will result in the familiar Rails 500 page. Let's dig into what might be going wrong.

Start tailing the app's logs.

```sh
cf logs $YOUR_UNIQUE_APP_NAME
```

Then refresh your browser. You'll see some output in the shell.

`2014-09-03T12:16:21.86+0100 [RTR]     OUT pivot-pws-tutorial-rails.cfapps.io - [03/09/2014:11:16:21 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 500 1477 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit/537.78.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.6 Safari/537.78.2" 10.10.2.122:18974 x_forwarded_for:"87.115.116.242" vcap_request_id:96f637b7-36f3-4f52-6f1f-1ed19e033656 response_time:0.008857278 app_id:cf33229e-b7b9-4636-a17d-0f3bbb70e0bd`


This does confirm that we're getting a 500, but we haven't yet configured Rails to output logs to STDOUT.

We could get the production log at its current location like this:

```sh
cf files $YOUR_UNIQUE_APP_NAME app/log/production.log
```

Inside the backtrace should be something along these lines:

```sh
PG::ConnectionBad (could not connect to server: No such file or directory
	Is the server running locally and accepting
	connections on Unix domain socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
):
```

Indeed, we haven't yet set up a database for PWS. But that was a cumbersome way to retrieve a backtrace.

### Installing the 12 factor gem

We have a problem in our configuration: our logs don't go to STDOUT. Setting up logs to go to STDOUT is [one of the 12 factors][12factordotnet-logs] that make an app suitable for deployment on a modern cloud platform like Cloud Foundry.

As it turns out, the Ruby Buildpack gave us a WARNING that we hadn't installed the 12 factor gem when we pushed. Let's do that now. Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_12factor', group: :production
```

Then re-bundle and push:

```
bundle
cf push $YOUR_UNIQUE_APP_NAME
```

Tailing the logs and refreshing the browser shows us the full error now, as we saw from the `cf files` invokation.

## Adding a database

Follow the instructions in the public *Getting Started* guide to install a service. The example is for a postgres database, which is what we want.

This is a good time to start using a manifest.yml. Follow the extra step in the public tutorial to configure this.

After this is done, your manifest.yml should look like this (this version is adapted to use bin/rake and bin/rails):

```sh
---
applications:
  - name: your-unique-app-name
    memory: 256M
    instances: 1
    path: .
    command: bin/rake db:migrate && bin/rails server -p $PORT
    services:
      - rails-postgres
```

Now push these changes. There's no need to include the app name since we've just configured it in the manifest.

```sh
cf push
```

Refresh your browser. You should now get the Rails 404 page, along the lines of 'The page you were looking for doesn't exist.'

A quick check of the production.log reveals we're missing a route for '/'. Let's put a page at '/' that will verify our database works, since a missing route doesn't tell us much about our database connectivity.

```sh
bin/rails generate resource Pant
echo 'Pants: <%= Pant.count %>' > app/views/pants/index.html.erb
```

Now edit config/routes.rb and change `resources :pants` to read:

```ruby
root "pants#index"
```

Migrate:

```sh
bin/rake db:migrate
```

Now check <http://localhost:3000/> to see that the count appears, then push the app:

```sh
cf push
```

Once the push is complete, visit your .cfapps.io URI and confirm that the same appears there as it did locally. It should say 'Pants: 0'.

## Connecting to the remote database with psql

Let's add a pair of pants to confirm that we're talking to the correct database.

Retrieve the database URI first.

```sh
cf env $YOUR_UNIQUE_APP_NAME
```

You can see from the output that there's a System-Provided environment variable called VCAP_SERVICES. An archaic name (VMware Certified Advanced Professional Services), this variable contains data about service instances.

If you copy the URI under VCAP_SERVICES.elephantsql[0].credentials.uri into psql you'll be connected to your DB.

```sh
psql $THE_URI_YOU_COPIED
insert into pants (created_at) values (now());
```

Refresh the page at the PWS-hosted URI in your browser and you should see 'Pants: 1'.

### So how did the app connect to the database?

You may have noticed that the checked-in config/database.yml is using the default Rails configuration. That is, the production stanza looks like this:

```yaml
production:
  <<: *default
  database: pivot_pws_tutorial_rails_production
  username: pivot_pws_tutorial_rails
  password: <%= ENV['PIVOT_PWS_TUTORIAL_RAILS_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
```

The above values are bogus, so how is PWS connecting to the database?

The Cloud Foundry Ruby buildpack will automatically extract the URI in VCAP_SERVICES and set it to DATABASE_URL if the latter isn't set (with `cf set-env`).

[Rails 4 will notice that a DATABASE_URL is set][rails-config-db] and use that instead of config/database.yml. The result is an ignored config file. You could safely delete the production stanza.

## Database migrations

At the time of writing, PWS doesn't support one-off tasks like Heroku's `heroku run`. However, for database migrations the usual technique is to run them during the application's startup. This is what is done in the above manifest.yml.

However, since an app of any size will likely have more than one instance, the trick is to only run the migrations on one instance. The public *Getting Started* guide has an example of setting up a rake task called 'cf:on_first_instance'. The manifest ends up looking like this:

```yaml
---
applications:
  - name: your-unique-app-name
    memory: 256M
    instances: 1
    path: .
    command: bin/rake cf:on_first_instance db:migrate && bin/rails server -p $PORT
    services:
      - rails-postgres
```

## Sponsorship

Any Labs project is eligible for its PWS costs to be covered by a sponsorship during its engagement. Once the project is handed off, the sponsorship will end and the client will be responsible for paying each PWS bill.
