# Getting started with [Pivotal Web Services][pws] (PWS) on Rails

This is a tutorial for Pivots who are familiar with Rails but not with [PWS][pws]. PWS is an installation of [Cloud Foundry][cf] that we host, similar to [Heroku][heroku]. You might use this tutorial if, for example, you know your Labs project wants to host on PWS.

There is a public-facing Getting Started with Rails on PWS guide (not available at time of writing) that details much of the process required to get started with PWS, including command line usage and project setup.

This tutorial is streamlined for Pivots, and includes extra information such as [how to request sponsorship for your organization][sponsorship].


## Sponsorship

Any Labs project is eligible for its PWS costs to be covered by a sponsorship during its engagement. Once the project is handed off, the sponsorship will end and the client will be responsible for paying each PWS bill.
